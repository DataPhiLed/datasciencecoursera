# datasciencecoursera
a required repo for a data science course at Johns Hopkins

Just to be safe, I'm also editing the readme file to add some personal information to the repo.
This is Phil Ledwith, for Coursera "the data scientist's toolbox", first course the data science specialization.
OKay, that should be enough.
